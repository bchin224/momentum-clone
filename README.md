# Momentum Chrome Extension Clone
This is a clone of the Google Chrome extension [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) that generates a new photo and quote with every page visit as well as displays the time weather of a given zipcode. It also greets the user, as every home app should!
